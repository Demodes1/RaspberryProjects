# Security AI

> **This code isn't fully finished yet, the face recognition system still requires to add some additional features, but it'll be developed soon :)**

Welcome to the **Security AI** GitHub repository! This is the official source code repository for the **Security AI** project, it is a project developed by students from the ITESM using multiple artificial intelligence sources to detect and respond to security threats. 

This repository contains all of the code necessary to build, maintain, and use the Security AI system. The code is organized into several major components, including the AI system itself, the database, and the tools used to deploy and manage the system.

The AI system is designed to detect security threats by using facial recognition and voice recognition to identify users. It will also use GPIO pins to control external hardware, such as LEDs, to provide visual feedback to users. Additionally, it uses a MySQL database to store user information, such as credentials and images.
